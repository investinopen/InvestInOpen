Today we are announcing the formation of Invest In Open Infrastructure (IOI) a global initiative to increase the availability and sustainability of open knowledge infrastructure.

The needs of today’s diverse scholarly communities are not being met by the existing largely uncoordinated scholarly infrastructure, which is dominated by vendor products that take ownership of the scholarly process and data without appropriate governance and oversight from the communities they serve. We imagine a world in which communities of researchers, scholars, and knowledge workers across the globe are fully enabled to share, discover, and collaborate using tools and platforms that are designed to interoperate and complement one another rather than compete and exclude.

IOI will consist of two functions, one is an assessment and recommendation framework that will regularly survey the landscape of open scholarly infrastructure with respect to its functionality, usage, health and financial needs and make funding recommendations for that infrastructure.

IOI’s second function will coordinate funds to follow the recommendations of the framework. Coordinating financial resources from institutions, agencies and foundations, we will work to increase the overall funding available to emerging and critical infrastructure.

IOI grew out of last year’s [Joint Roadmap for Open Scholarly Tools (JROST)](https://jrost.org/) and within the context of [Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/), the [European Open Science Cloud](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=open-science-cloud), the [US NAS Open Science by Design](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25116/open-science-by-design-realizing-a-vision-for-21st-century) effort, [SCOSS](http://scoss.org/), [AmeliCA](http://www.amelica.org/en/), and the [UC Declaration of Rights and Principles to Transform Scholarly Communication](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/committees/ucolasc/scholcommprinciples-20180425.pdf). It’s clear that while the advances of digital scholarship have resulted in many benefits, that scientists and scholars who generally work in the public interest have a need for more open infrastructure which mirrors their social focus.

As Geoffrey Bilder, Jennifer Lin and Cameron Neylon [put it in 2015](http://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/): "Everything we have gained by opening content and data will be under threat if we allow the enclosure of scholarly infrastructures."

IOI is a collaboration between many, including the [Joint Roadmap for Open Scholarly Tools (JROST)](https://jrost.org/), [SPARC Europe](https://sparceurope.org/), [SPARC](https://sparcopen.org/), [Mapping the Scholarly Communication Infrastructure](https://scholarlycommons.net/map/), [Open Research Funders Group (ORFG)](http://www.orfg.org/), [OPERAS](http://operas-eu.org), and the [Open Platforms Group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDn6uex8o5n8VxuXsPkxJjWSA9jNeWVLGvMIvCl-5zY/edit).

Our [steering committee](https://investinopen.org/participants) includes Ginny Barbour (Australasian Open Access Strategy Group), Arianna Becerril (Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México), Leslie Chan (University of Toronto Scarborough), Raym Crow (SPARC), Peg Fowler (Hypothesis), Heather Joseph (SPARC), Pierre Mounier (OPERAS), Cameron Neylon (Curtin Univ), David Lewis (Mapping the Scholarly Communications Infrastructure), Lucy Ofiesh (Center for Open Science), Vanessa Proudman (SPARC Europe), Kristen Ratan (Coko Foundation), Danielle Robinson (Code for Science and Society), Mike Roy (Middlebury College), Katherine Skinner (Educopia), Ina Smith (Academy of Science of South Africa), Greg Tananbaum (Open Research Funders Group), Evviva Weinraub (Northwestern), Dan Whaley (Hypothesis), and Maurice York (University of Michigan).

This is the beginning of a process for which community feedback, a truly global perspective, and participation by all stakeholders will be critical to its success.

With this announcement, IOI:

* Calls for feedback on our [aims and goals](https://investinopen.org/docs/statement0.2), which today are posted on our website at [investinopen.org](https://investinopen.org).
* Invites you to [add your institution’s support](https://investinopen.org/supporters) for this initiative.
* Invites you to [contribute to the Census of Scholarly Communication Infrastructure](https://investinopen.org/census).
* Invites you to [join one of our scheduled webinars](https://forms.gle/DhzjNowfyyJLHn7dA) which will provide a deeper dive on IOI.
* Asks that you [subscribe to receive further information](https://investinopen.org/contact) if you’re interested.

As next steps we will be securing funding to support several leadership positions, and will be recruiting in both Europe, the United States and beyond. Prospective candidates or those with recommendations should email [info@investinopen.org](mailto:info@investinopen.org).

We appreciate the various voices who have shared their perspective about this effort:

## Dr. Virginia Barbour, Director Australasian Open Access Strategy Group (AOASG)
> "The Australasian Open Access Strategy Group recognises the critical need for sustainable, open infrastructure to support open scholarship. The increasing consolidation of scholarly infrastructure in the hands of commercial organisations poses a substantial threat to the future of open scholarship and its transformative potential, and risks mirroring the position we currently see in the ownership of journals. We therefore welcome the formation of the Invest In Open Infrastructure initiative, supports its aims and look forward to collaborating in future."

## Karina Batthyány, CLACSO's Executive Secretary, and Dominique Babini, CLACSO's Open Access Advisor
> "The Latin American Council of Social Sciences (CLACSO) &mdash; a network of 680 research institutions in 52 countries &mdash; welcomes and congratulates the Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI) initiative. In Latin America, where research and scholarly communications are mainly publicly-funded, community-led, free to read and publish, and has active regional open infrastructures, there is a strong need for international coordination to raise our governments awareness of the need of public investment in open science/open access/open evaluation indicators infrastructures. And global collective investment is needed to strengthen the existing regional initiatives in our region to adapt its infrastructure and procedures to comply with growing demands of open science and evaluation review, and to be able to contribute to the advancement of community-controlled open science infrastructure worldwide."

## Chris Bourg, Director of Libraries, MIT
> "With the right infrastructure, created and sustained by and for the scholarly community, we have the potential to fully unleash our cumulative knowledge on solving the world’s greatest challenges and addressing growing information inequality. Global, collective investment in open community owned infrastructure is essential to the future of open science.
>
> Creating a future where ‘enduring, abundant, equitable, and meaningful access to information serves to empower and inspire humanity’ (our vision at MIT Libraries) requires global collaboration and new means of collective investment in infrastructure that reflects and supports the values we hold dear in academia and knowledge-producing communities everywhere."

## Leslie Chan, Centre for Critical Development Studies, University of Toronto Scarborough
> "Amidst debates about the costs and the funding for open access, the far more fundamental question about the control, governance, and sustainability of scholarly infrastructure has been largely neglected. Infrastructure is a powerful enabler, but it also limits or constraints what’s possible. It is therefore highly essential that we design infrastructure from the start with the broad interests of the community in mind, rather than allowing the profit driven and privately controlled infrastructure to manufacture demands and create dependency on their services. IOI represents a convergence of diverse stakeholders, collective energies, and a shared vision of a common framework for open infrastructure built by the community for the community. It will create new thinkings about sustainability, about openness, about community governancer, and about collective actions. It is incredibly exciting to be part of this groundbreaking initiative!"

## Professor Etienne Ehouan Ehile, Secretary General of the Association of African Universities
> "The African Higher Education Institutions and the communities of researchers, scholars, and other global knowledge workers need products, tools and infrastructure to fully enable them to share, discover, and work together. The ownership of the scholarly process and data must remain with the researchers who produce it. The [Association of African Universities](https://www.aau.org/) supports the creation of open infrastructure systems to enable research and knowledge communities to work in more integrated, collaborative and strategic ways."

## Heather Joseph, Executive Director, SPARC
> “At SPARC, we’re committed to making 'open' the default for research and education. This means making sure not only that research outputs are made openly available, but also that the infrastructure needed to produce, share, and fully use the knowledge created by the global scholarly community is designed to support this aim as well. The IOI ('Invest in Open Infrastructure') initiative aims to provide collective support for developing and sustaining open infrastructure to ensure that it operates in ways that are aligned with the values of the scholarly community it serves. We’re delighted to join with our colleagues around the world to support this important and timely initiative, and to celebrate its official launch today.”

## David W. Lewis, Dean Emeritus of the IUPUI University Library
> "Digital technology, if it is open, has the potential to make the results of research and scholarship freely and easily available to everyone anywhere who wishes to use them. To make this possible requires an open infrastructure to support the discovery, access, evaluation, and preservation of research results. Today the available open infrastructure is underfunded and uncoordinated. It is simply not up to the task. It requires more and wiser investment. This is what the IOI initiative seeks to provide. It is a critical step in creating the system of scholarly communication the world, with all the challenges we face, needs."

## Cameron Neylon, Co-author of the Principles for Open Scholarly Infrastructures
> "Infrastructure can be the great leveller. This was our core motivation in writing the Principles, that infrastructure built by the community, for the community, and with broader communities has the potential to solve existing problems, enable new classes of solution, and most importantly create value that is harnessed by the community and stays within it. The IOI initiative is a step towards reshaping what we are capable of in scholarly communications, by enabling the maintenance and building of platforms that enhance our collective capacity to build knowledge."

## Lucy Ofiesh, Center for Open Science
> "IOI was established as the logical evolution of a series of open infrastructure projects, that together, have the capacity to realize a new future for global scholarship. The power of IOI is in each group's distinct expertise paired with a shared vision to improve research and accelerate discovery."

## David Prosser, Executive Director, RLUK (Research Libraries United Kingdom)
> "In the UK we have long recognised the value of open infrastructure for open scholarship &mdash; for example, though our long-term funding of resources such as the SHERPA/RoMEO database or Directory of Open Access Journals. However, we also recognise the challenges in building and maintaining these resources in a sustainable manner. As UK funders further refine their open access policies having signed Plan S, open infrastructure becomes ever more important for our authors and institutions. We therefore very much welcome further coordinated efforts to provide the basic underpinnings of a fair and equitable open system of scholarly communications."

## Kristen Ratan, CoFounder, Coko
> "For open infrastructure to support global scholarship, research and education, we need a thriving network of open source builders, services, and solutions providers. This can create a new open economy that is sustainable and breeds innovation. The IOI is a crucial step in making this vision a reality by being a clearinghouse of information and resources as well as a channel for funding and long term support."

## Mike Roy, Dean of the Library, Middlebury College
> "We have all known for years the problems with our current 'system' of scholarly communication. Still, no obvious path forward has yet emerged to enable the scholarly community to regain control over this system, and to take advantage of the power of networked information to deliver on its promises to support the work of research and education in the service of improving the world and addressing the world’s most pressing challenges. IOI represents a practical way forward: visionary, global, inclusive, grass roots, and informed by lessons learned in working in this area for decades."

## Greg Tananbaum, Project Coordinator, Open Research Funders Group (ORFG)
>"The Open Research Funders Group (ORFG) is pleased to support the launch of Invest In Open Infrastructure (IOI). As philanthropies committed to the open sharing of research outputs, we welcome this initiative that aims to coordinate the creation and ongoing development of open source tools that facilitate open scholarship, research, and education. The ORFG is fully supportive of the IOI’s long-term mission to create a shared, open, and interoperable infrastructure for enabling 21st-century scholarly communications. We look forward to working with IOI to develop a framework to track relevant activities, facilitate coordination across projects, and identify areas for wise strategic investment."

## Dan Whaley, CEO, Hypothesis
> "Entrepreneurs who are inspired to solve problems in scholarly infrastructure by creating innovative, durable open projects face nearly insurmountable challenges in finding startup funding and sustaining income to do so. If we can lower the barriers for projects like these, we will inspire a new generation of passionate builders to help us create the infrastructure we’ll need to move open science and scholarship forward.
>
>I am overwhelmed by the support and solidarity that we’ve had from an extraordinary range of organizations, institutions, foundations and individuals in forming Invest in Open Infrastructure. It’s clear that the time is now for a coordinated global effort to tackle this problem."
