IOI is a new group whose purpose is to design a new system to provide long-term financial sustainability for non-profit organizations and projects that provide essential tools and services that institutions and agencies rely on. This workshop will share a first draft of the IOI vision, mission and possible roadmap. The presentation will be followed by a panel discussion. This session is mainly to acquire feedback from participants on the different components of the initiative before it gets started: exploring the needs to create more integrated approaches to infrastructure and its funding, exploring possible funding mechanisms, and elaborating on what a common framework might look like and how it could serve various communities.
