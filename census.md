# Join the Census
The Census of Scholarly Communication Infrastructure is now open for completion by any/all scholarly communication resources (tools, services, platforms). We invite projects and programs, for profit and nonprofit corporations, and hosted initiatives of all kinds to contribute to this growing body of information.

## Background
The Invest in Open Initiative seeks to deepen our understandings of 1) the organizational and technical infrastructures represented within existing scholarly communication resources (tools, services, platforms); and 2) the funding and investment models that currently support these tools, services, and platforms.

To that end, in Spring 2019, IOI worked with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded “Mapping the Scholarly Communication Infrastructure” project (Middlebury, 2018&ndash;2019), to develop and launch a Census of Scholarly Communication Infrastructure. This Census has been completed by more than 45 invited scholarly communication resources, and it provides baseline and aggregate data that help us to better understand the organizational and technical infrastructures currently supporting the scholarly communication system.
