# Join the Census
The Census of Scholarly Communication Infrastructure is now open for completion by scholarly communication resources (tools, services, platforms). We invite projects and programs, for profit and nonprofit corporations, and hosted initiatives of all kinds to contribute to this growing body of information.
* [Sign Up to Participate](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cKv8Q0JciChMavSBq0e_5S5qdQnW_H6s6TAR0wfHJmU/edit): We will send you a login that will enable you to start and stop the survey at your convenience.
* [Participate in the Census](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Census2019): You can also just take the census without signing up, which means you have to complete it in one sitting.
* [PDF of the Census Instrument](https://educopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Census_2019_Open05132019.pdf): Preview all the questions on the survey, some of which you won’t have to answer due to the branching logic of the survey.

## Background
The Invest in Open Initiative (IOI) seeks to deepen our understanding of 1) the organizational and technical infrastructures represented within existing scholarly communication resources (tools, services, platforms); and 2) the funding and investment models that currently support these tools, services, and platforms.

To that end, in Spring 2019, IOI worked with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation-funded "[Mapping the Scholarly Communication Infrastructure](https://scholarlycommons.net/map/)" project (Middlebury, 2018–2019), to develop and launch a Census of Scholarly Communication Infrastructure. This Census has been completed by more than 40 invited scholarly communication resources, and it provides baseline and aggregate data that help us to better understand the organizational and technical infrastructures currently supporting the scholarly communication system.

The report "[Mapping the Scholarly Communication Landscape – 2019 Census](https://educopia.org/educopia-releases-mapping-the-scholarly-communications-landscape-2019-census/)" based on the first round of the census was published in June of 2019.

We plan to close the second round of the census on **1 September 2019**.
